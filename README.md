# UFO

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to create a webpage which shows UFO sightings in a table and also takes into account filters by the user. Dana wants to write about UFO sightings in Oregon. We are helping her with all the filters using javascript. 

### Results
You can filter the search by typing the state and seeing what comes up. By default, it will be on roswell CA, but for example I looked at the sightings in New Hampshire one spot from Windham came up.

#### Analysis
The one drawback of this is that it these is not enough color variation on this webpage. To improve this we can edit the css file, and add more images.
